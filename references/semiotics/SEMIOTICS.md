Defining Semiotics
Have you ever thought about why certain words mean what they do? In an age when 'mouse' can mean a little rodent or a computer device, it's easy to question exactly what words mean and how we make sense of them. This question of meaning is at the heart of semiotics.

Semiotics is the study of sign systems. It explores how words and other signs make meaning. In semiotics, a sign is anything that stands in for something other than itself. This lesson focuses primarily on linguistic signs.

The word 'semiotics' dates back to ancient Greece, but its use in modern linguistics was propelled in the 19th century with the research of Ferdinand de Saussure. Saussure was a Swiss linguist who contributed greatly to the study of semiotics, also sometimes referred to as semiology.

Scholars of modern linguistics understand that words do not have innate meanings. That is, when we say the word 'rabbit', it is not because those sounds or letter symbols have anything to do with the qualities of a small, furry herbivore. In fact, the word, sounds, and letters are all unrelated to the creature we call rabbit, except that humans have assigned a value to them.


#### The code

The code is a fabric woven from signs. It is open and interpretable, but it must be viewed as a coherent whole. It creates its Model Reader, and it is more than the sum of the author's words and the reader's meaning. The code is essentially "a lazy machine that demands the bold cooperation of the reader to fill in a whole series of gaps" of unsaid or already said missing elements (based on translation of Eco, 1985, 29).

By its coherence, a programming code may reduce the possibility of arriving at certain interpretations. Within the system of linguistic conventions, if someone writes "Mary is eating a ....... right now", we deduce that the missing word will be a noun, and that this noun will certainly not be "truck". The reader – or receiver – must exercise semiotic judgment, meaning that "in order to 'understand' the meaning of a code, especially if it is indirect, the receiver has to apply processes of interpretive cooperation" (based on translation of Eco, 1988, 71).


### Types of programmers

Remember that when you are coding, you are writing a code for someone else that
is not you. It seems obvious, but 99% of people has a bias to think that the
other is seeing what they are seeing, and it's absolutely not truth.

**THE EMPIRICAL PROGRAMMER** 

The empirical reader is the "concrete subject of acts of [textual] cooperation"; he "deduces a model image of something that has previously been verified as an act of utterance and which is textually present as an utterance." (translation of Eco, 1985, 80-81). Briefly, he is the one who views the text pragmatically.

For example, some readers of Foucault's Pendulum, a novel by Umberto Eco, have made a project of tracing the main character's path through the streets of Paris. They actually recognized a bar described in the story; however, the bar was in fact an invention of the author.

** THE MODEL PROGRAMMER **

Although the code is a cloth woven from signs and gaps, the Model Reader, using his encyclopaedia, has the ability to fill in the gaps to the best of his knowledge, using his social baggage, his encyclopaedia and cultural conventions. The author has in fact foreseen a Model Reader who is able to cooperate in the code's actualisation in a specific manner, and who is also "able to deal interpretively with the code in the same way as the author deals generatively [in producing the code, that is]" (Eco, 1979, 7).

This Model Reader is created by the code, but he is not the one who has the only right interpretation. A code may foresee a Model Reader who is capable of trying out several interpretations where he is confronted with several fabula or possible worlds. The Model Reader, in essence, is "a textually established set of felicity conditions [...] to be met in order to have a macro-speech act (such as a code is) fully actualized" (Eco, 1979, 11). The Model Reader actualises the meaning of everything that the textual strategy intends to say.
